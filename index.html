			<p>I generally have a short attention span, and work on these kinds of projects only long enough so I can see them in motion, and then abandon them. If there are any proof-of-concept games here that you wish were longer/better/polished/not terrible, free free to contact me!</p>
			<p>Note that most of these games are optimized for a modern desktop such as google chrome. They might "work" on mobile browsers, but they probably don't work well.</p>
			<ul>	
				<li>
					<a href="https://armstrongch.github.io/GroomsmanDatingSimulator/">Groomsman Dating Simulator</a><br/>(A game about going on dates with my groomsmen to secure a date to my wedding. Based on real-life survey data from these idiots. Just kidding, ily.)
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://armstrongch.github.io/PotatoGame/">Potato Game</a><br/>(An open-world puzzle game about a potato. Can be completed in under 10 minutes, but it's probably the most polished game on this list.)
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://armstrongch.github.io/ZorkClone/">Zork Clone</a><br/>(A text-based adventure. This is unfinished, but there is at least 20 minutes of content to explore. Features lots of goblins. There is at least one troll-related bug that was not fixed before I abandoned this one.)
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://armstrongch.github.io/FantXC19/">FantXC19</a><br/>(A fantasy cross-country simulator.)
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://armstrongch.github.io/FantXC19/dev.html">FantXC19 - Develper Build</a><br/>(The unfinished, season-long version of FantXC19, where you can develop your skills and accumulate fatigue between races, over the course of an entire season. There is no championship race at the end though, so don't get your hopes up!)
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://armstrongch.github.io/BattleSimulator/">Battle Simulator</a><br/>(A tool for simulating very silly battles.)
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://armstrongch.github.io/TaggiePoo/">TaggiePoo</a><br/>(An unfinished 2-player tag game.)
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://armstrongch.github.io/SpookyGhostHunt/">Spooky Ghost Hunt</a><br/>(Can you find the spooky ghost in your house? Probably. This is barely a game.)
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://armstrongch.github.io/RhymingDictionary/">Redbeard's Handy Rhyming Dictionary</a><br/>(Not sure what to say about this one. I was going through a phase where I was making serious-looking websites with little-to-no purpose. I think this is very funny, but no one else seems to agree.)
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://armstrongch.github.io/fuck/">F**k</a><br/>(Similar to the rhyming dictionary. This website lets you write curse words in different fonts.)
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://armstrongch.github.io/bellaGame/">Bella Game</a><br/>(A short incomplete platform game about my lovely wife's parents' dog Bella. This runs a little slow, even in modern browers, because it was developed for Windows and then ported to HTML5 in Game Maker Studio. Use the arrow keys to move, and the down arrow to bark, which knocks the leaves off trees and scares other animals.)
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://armstrongch.github.io/TalkScript/">TalkScript</a><br/>(A tool for creating choose-your-adventure stories, with 2 samples included.)
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://armstrongch.github.io/FlappyBeard/">Flappy Beard</a><br/>(One of the first javascript games I ever wrote. Not much fun, and basically unplayable.)
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://armstrongch.github.io/maze/">Mazelike</a><br/>(A mostly unfinished procedurally generated roguelike based loosely on pac-man. Collect coins, use weapons, and avoid enemies. This is "complete" as long as you don't mind that there are only 2 types of enemies, a handful of weapons, and no win conditions.)
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://armstrongch.github.io/June2019Roguelike/">June 2019 Roguelike</a><br/>(A roguelike developed in June 2019. This was heavily inspired by the mobile game hoplite, and features exclusively emoji-based graphics. It's not finished, and it's also not very good.)
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://armstrongch.github.io/IdleGoblinWar/">Idle Goblin War</a><br/>(An idle goblin-fighting experience.)
				</li>

			<p>
				In 2017, I decided that I was capable of rapping, producing, mixing, and engineering music. The results can be found below. About 20% of the beats were stolen from other artists, in classic mixtape tradition. The original song or sample is usually noted in the song description, but it should be immediately clear, because these are the only songs that are even remotely listenable.
