			<p>I generally have a short attention span, and work on these kinds of projects only long enough so I can see them in motion, and then abandon them. If there are any proof-of-concept games here that you wish were longer/better/polished/not terrible, free free to contact me!</p>
			<p>Note that most of these games are optimized for a modern desktop such as google chrome. They might "work" on mobile browsers, but they probably don't work well.</p>
			<ul>	
				<li>
					<a href="https://armstrongch.github.io/GroomsmanDatingSimulator/">Groomsman Dating Simulator</a><br/>(A game about going on dates with my groomsmen to secure a date to my wedding. Based on real-life survey data from these idiots. Just kidding, ily.)

				<li>
					<a href="https://armstrongch.github.io/PotatoGame/">Potato Game</a><br/>(An open-world puzzle game about a potato. Can be completed in under 10 minutes, but it's probably the most polished game on this list.)

				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://armstrongch.github.io/FantXC19/">FantXC19</a><br/>(A fantasy cross-country simulator.)

There is no championship race at the end though, so don't get your hopes up!)

				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://armstrongch.github.io/RhymingDictionary/">Redbeard's Handy Rhyming Dictionary</a><br/>(Not sure what to say about this one. I was going through a phase where I was making serious-looking websites with little-to-no purpose. I think this is very funny, but no one else seems to agree.)
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://armstrongch.github.io/fuck/">F**k</a><br/>(Similar to the rhyming dictionary. This website lets you write curse words in different fonts.)

				<li>
					<a href="https://armstrongch.github.io/bellaGame/">Bella Game</a><br/>(A short incomplete platform game about my lovely wife's parents' dog Bella. This runs a little slow, even in modern browers, because it was developed for Windows and then ported to HTML5 in Game Maker Studio. Use the arrow keys to move, and the down arrow to bark, which knocks the leaves off trees and scares other animals.)

				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://armstrongch.github.io/maze/">Mazelike</a><br/>(A mostly unfinished procedurally generated roguelike based loosely on pac-man. Collect coins, use weapons, and avoid enemies. This is "complete" as long as you don't mind that there are only 2 types of enemies, a handful of weapons, and no win conditions.)
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://armstrongch.github.io/June2019Roguelike/">June 2019 Roguelike</a><br/>(A roguelike developed in June 2019. This was heavily inspired by the mobile game hoplite, and features exclusively emoji-based graphics. It's not finished, and it's also not very good.)

			<p>
				In 2017, I decided that I was capable of rapping, producing, mixing, and engineering music. The results can be found below. About 20% of the beats were stolen from other artists, in classic mixtape tradition. The original song or sample is usually noted in the song description, but it should be immediately clear, because these are the only songs that are even remotely listenable.

					(This is a google drive link to a zip file full of miscellaneous games I created as a child. They are all in .exe format, play exclusively on windows computers, and may crash when you get to the end. Below is a non-comprehensive list of what might be in there.)
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Battle Maze: A 2-player game about battling in a maze, circa 2007</li>
					<li>Munchies of Flame 2: A top-down shooter, circa 2008</li>
					<li>After Dark: A top-down zombie survival game, circa 2009</li>
					<li>Badminton: Badminton, circa 2009</li>
					<li>Volleyball: Volleyball, circa 2009</li>
					<li>Strategy Command: A top-down shooter disguised as a strategy game, circa 2009</li>
					<li>High Noon: A high-noon cowboy dueling game, circa 2010</li>
					<li>Man vs. Beast Reloaded: A 2-player asymmetrical competitive game, possible the first one worth playing, circa 2010</li>
					<li>CTF: A 4-player split-screen capture-the-flag playformer. Looks like absolutely chaos, circa 2010</li>
					<li>The Best Maze Game Ever: An unfair trial-and-error "puzzle" game, which probably crashes on the last level, circa 2010</li>
					<li>James Challenge: A co-op puzzle game, inspired by Chips Challenge, and developed one summer with my neighbor. I stand by this one, circa 2012</li>
					<li>Mini Rogue: A procedurally generated roguelite dungeon crawler. Another gem, though there isn't much content beyond the 6 or so unique enemy types, circa 2012</li>
					<li>Ludicrous Monkey Fight: A 2-player game of some kind, circa 2012</li>
					<li>Hallway: Barely a game, circa 2012</li>
					<li>Murderfight: A 4-player, one-button, clockwise action game, actually really fun, circa 2012</li>
					<li>Soviet Summer: A full adventure game, developed for a highschool project. 30 minutes of gameplay, circa 2013</li>
					<li>Wargame Tactics: A 2-player tactical top-down shooter. A cool idea that was never fully realized, circa 2013</li>
					<li>Dragon Garden vs. The Space Cult: A complete gardening/alien-fighting game developed for SamJam, circa 2015</li>
					<li>Skeleton Scramble: The original Skeleton Game, a 2-player tower-defense hero RTS. Possible the best game I have ever created, circa 2015</li>
					<li>Skeleton Game: The remake of the original Skeleton game in Game Maker Studio. This has up to 4 players, xbox controller support, and significantly more buildings and units. Though unfinished and unpolished, my friends and I played this for hours, circa 2016</li>
					<li>Assault 2: A 4-player top-down competitive shooter. This is from approximately 2012, but was ported to a different version of Game Maker in 2019.</li>
					<li>Munchies Reloaded: A remake of Munchies of Flame 2, circa 2013. Some friends have called this my best game ever, and I think it crashes on the last level.</li>
					<li>Heist: An unfinished heist game. Date unknown. Honestly, you can skip this one.</li>
