			<p>I generally have a short attention span, and work on these kinds of projects only long enough so I can see them in motion, and then abandon them. If there are any proof-of-concept games here that you wish were longer/better/polished/not terrible, free free to contact me!</p>
			<p>Note that most of these games are optimized for a modern desktop such as google chrome. They might "work" on mobile browsers, but they probably don't work well.</p>

					(This is a google drive link to a zip file full of miscellaneous games I created as a child. They are all in .exe format, play exclusively on windows computers, and may crash when you get to the end. Below is a non-comprehensive list of what might be in there.)
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Battle Maze: A 2-player game about battling in a maze, circa 2007</li>
					<li>Munchies of Flame 2: A top-down shooter, circa 2008</li>
					<li>After Dark: A top-down zombie survival game, circa 2009</li>
					<li>Badminton: Badminton, circa 2009</li>
					<li>Volleyball: Volleyball, circa 2009</li>
					<li>Strategy Command: A top-down shooter disguised as a strategy game, circa 2009</li>
					<li>High Noon: A high-noon cowboy dueling game, circa 2010</li>
					<li>Man vs. Beast Reloaded: A 2-player asymmetrical competitive game, possible the first one worth playing, circa 2010</li>
					<li>CTF: A 4-player split-screen capture-the-flag playformer. Looks like absolutely chaos, circa 2010</li>
					<li>The Best Maze Game Ever: An unfair trial-and-error "puzzle" game, which probably crashes on the last level, circa 2010</li>
					<li>James Challenge: A co-op puzzle game, inspired by Chips Challenge, and developed one summer with my neighbor. I stand by this one, circa 2012</li>
					<li>Mini Rogue: A procedurally generated roguelite dungeon crawler. Another gem, though there isn't much content beyond the 6 or so unique enemy types, circa 2012</li>
					<li>Ludicrous Monkey Fight: A 2-player game of some kind, circa 2012</li>
					<li>Hallway: Barely a game, circa 2012</li>
					<li>Murderfight: A 4-player, one-button, clockwise action game, actually really fun, circa 2012</li>
					<li>Soviet Summer: A full adventure game, developed for a highschool project. 30 minutes of gameplay, circa 2013</li>
					<li>Wargame Tactics: A 2-player tactical top-down shooter. A cool idea that was never fully realized, circa 2013</li>
					<li>Dragon Garden vs. The Space Cult: A complete gardening/alien-fighting game developed for SamJam, circa 2015</li>
					<li>Skeleton Scramble: The original Skeleton Game, a 2-player tower-defense hero RTS. Possible the best game I have ever created, circa 2015</li>
					<li>Skeleton Game: The remake of the original Skeleton game in Game Maker Studio. This has up to 4 players, xbox controller support, and significantly more buildings and units. Though unfinished and unpolished, my friends and I played this for hours, circa 2016</li>
					<li>Assault 2: A 4-player top-down competitive shooter. This is from approximately 2012, but was ported to a different version of Game Maker in 2019.</li>
					<li>Munchies Reloaded: A remake of Munchies of Flame 2, circa 2013. Some friends have called this my best game ever, and I think it crashes on the last level.</li>
					<li>Heist: An unfinished heist game. Date unknown. Honestly, you can skip this one.</li>
